<summary>"Missing runtime version from app.json/app.config.js"</summary>
<br/>
  
If during `setup-ci` execution you see one of the following errors: 
> `Error: [android.manifest]: withAndroidManifestBaseMod: A runtime version is set in your AndroidManifest.xml, but is missing from your app.json/app.config.js. Please either set runtimeVersion in your app.json/app.config.js or remove expo.modules.updates.EXPO_RUNTIME_VERSION from your AndroidManifest.xml.`

> `Error: [ios.expoPlist]: withIosExpoPlistBaseMod: A runtime version is set in your Expo.plist, but is missing from your app.json/app.`

You either need to remove `android/` and `ios/`
directories in your project and re-run (if your project is using [CNG](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/)),
or add `runtimeVersion` field to your `app.json`/`app.config.js` file.
