# Node/Bun version

To make all workflows generated by SCI as consistent as possible, each of them has a step 
where specific version of node or bun is set. It should look more or less like this:

```yaml
- name: ðŸŒ¿ Setup Node
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version-file: ".nvmrc"
    cache: "yarn"
```

in case your package manager is `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm`, and like this:

```yaml
- name: ðŸ¥Ÿ Setup Bun
  uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
  with:
    bun-version-file: ".bun-version" : 
```

if your project uses `bun`.

For more information, check [actions/setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node) 
and [actions/setup-bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/setup-bun).

## Caching global package manager data

Note the field `cache` in setup step. It is set to your package manager to enable caching of global packages data.

:::caution
`node_modules` is not cached.

## Node version file

The `node-version-file` field will be set to point to a file in your repository from which 
node version should be retrieved. Possible values are:

- `.nvmrc` if exists,
- `.node-version` if exists,
- `package.json`, if either `engines.node` or `volta.node` fields are specified.

If SCI fails to detect files satisfying these conditions, it will create `.nvmrc` file in your project with 
default node version.

Also, the workflow step will have the field `cache` set to your package manager to enable global packages data caching.

## Bun version file

Similarly to how SCI detects node version and creates `.nvmrc` file in case of failure, if your
projects uses `bun` and SCI fails to detect `.bun-version` file, it will create it with default bun version,
which will be provided in generated workflows in the `bun-version-file` field.
