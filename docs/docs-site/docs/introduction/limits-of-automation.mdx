# Limits of automation

Although SCI is designed to automate as much as possible, there are some limitations to what it can do. In such cases, you will need to perform manual steps.
Hovewer, **SCI will always provide you with instructions** on what needs to be done
in form of a **"What next?"** list printed at the end of script execution, or during the
execution using interactive prompts.

Example of a "What next?" list printed at the end of script execution:

![what-next](/img/introduction/what_next.png)

Example of a manual step instruction during the execution:

![manual-step-detox](/img/introduction/manual_step_detox.png)

## Examples of manual steps

Some of the tasks that SCI cannot automate include:

- Patching native mobile code
- Updating dynamic configuration files (e.g. `app.config.js`)
- Creating repository secrets (e.g. `EXPO_TOKEN`)
