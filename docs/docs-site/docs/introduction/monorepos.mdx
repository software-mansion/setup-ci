# Support for monorepos

All the features provided by SCI are available in monorepos as well! The only difference is that the configuration will be adjusted to work in a monorepo structure.

:::caution
If you want to run SCI for a package in monorepo structure, **run it from the root of this package (where package's `package.json` is located)**, not the monorepo root directory.
:::

## Monorepo specific behavior

SCI automatically detects if you run it in a monorepo and adjusts the configuration accordingly. It
peforms all necessary changes on the package level and generates workflows in `.github/workflows` directory at the root of the monorepo.

Workflows generated in monorepos are a bit different to ensure that they work correctly in monorepo structure. This difference involves both the name of workflow file
and its content. Check out the following example usage for more details.

## Example usage in monorepo

Assume we have a monorepo with the following structure:

```bash
repo
├── apps
│   ├── package-a
│   │   └── ...
│   └── package-b
│       └── ...
├── package.json
└── yarn.lock
```

Say that `package-a` is a react native app for which we want to set up GitHub actions for Prettier and Maestro. We can run:

```bash
cd apps/package-a
npx setup-ci --preset --prettier --maestro
```

After running the script, we can see that a `.github/` directory has been created in monorepo root with the following content:

```bash {2,3,4,5}
repo
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       ├── package-a-maestro.yml
│       └── package-a-prettier.yml
├── apps
│   ├── package-a
│   │   └── file
│   └── package-b
│       └── file
├── package.json
└── yarn.lock
```

These are the workflows that SCI generated for `package-a`. Note that their name starts with the name of the package.
This is to ensure that all workflows generated in monorepo have unique names and can be easily identified.

If we inspect the contents of `package-a-prettier.yml`, we can see
some quirks specific to workflows generated in monorepos.

```yaml {5,6,19,26} title=".github/workflows/package-a-prettier.yml" showLineNumbers
name: Prettier check

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - apps/package-a/**

jobs:
  prettier-check:
    name: Prettier check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: 🏗 Setup repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: 🌿 Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: "apps/package-a/.nvmrc"
          cache: "yarn"

      - name: 📦 Install dependencies
        run: yarn install --immutable

      - name: ✨ Run Prettier check
        run: yarn --cwd apps/package-a prettier:check
```

- Lines 5-6: the `paths` field ensures that the workflow runs only when changes are made in `apps/package-a` directory
- Line 19: the path to `.nvmrc` file is adjusted to point to `package-a` directory
- Line 26: the `yarn` command uses `--cwd` flag to specify in which package it should be run (for npm projects, the `npm run --prefix` option is used)
