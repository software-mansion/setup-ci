# Node version

To make all workflows generated by SCI as consistent as possible, each of them has a step 
where specific version of node is set. It should look more or less like this:

```yaml
- name: ðŸŒ¿ Setup Node
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version-file: ".nvmrc"
    cache: "yarn"
```

For more information about check [actions/setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node).

## Node version file

The `node-version-file` field will be set to point to a file in your repository from which 
node version should be retrieved. Possible values are:

- `.nvmrc` if exists,
- `.node-version` if exists,
- `package.json`, if either `engines.node` or `volta.node` fields are specified.

If SCI fails to detect files satisfying these conditions, it will create `.nvmrc` file in your project with 
default node version.

## Cache

The field `cache` will be set to your package manager to enable global packages data caching.

:::caution
`node_modules` is not cached.
