# Package Managers

SCI will automatically detect your package manager based on the presence of a `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` file in the root of your repository.
This step is crucial to ensure that dependencies are installed properly and generated workflows work as expected.

:::caution
In case both `yarn.lock` and `package-lock.json` are detected, the script will default to one of them with undefined priority.
