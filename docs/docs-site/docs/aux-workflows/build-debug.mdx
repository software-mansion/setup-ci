# Debug build

Workflow that builds the app in debug mode for Android and iOS.

This workflow can be triggered by other workflows depending on it.

:::info
Additionally, Debug build workflow is triggered every time new code is pushed to `main` branch 
for caching purposes. This way, every branch will be able to use the cached build. More information about cache scoping can be found here: 
[GitHub Docs: Matching a cache key](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#matching-a-cache-key).
:::

## Usage 

This workflow cannot be explicitly specified to be generated using SCI. It will be generated automatically
if you choose to create workflow depending on it.


## Detailed behavior

Below you can find detailed information about what the script does with your project when generating Debug Build workflow.

### Fingerprint

This workflow takes advantage from the fact that debug builds need to be remade only if native code changes.

It uses [@expo/fingerprint](https://expo.dev/blog/fingerprint-your-native-runtime) to generate 
a hash string of your native code (called _fingerprint_) to cache debug builds and create new 
builds only if necessary.

This logic is extracted to auxiliary reusable workflow `lookup-cached-debug-build`. You can find more
information about it here: [Lookup cached debug build](/docs/aux-workflows/lookup-cached-debug-build).

### Caching

Built apps will be cached using [actions/cache](https://github.com/actions/cache) using keys 
`android-debug-build-${{ android-fingerprint }}` and 
`ios-debug-build-${{ ios-fingerprint }}` (fingerprints for Android and iOS apps are different).

Note that this save a significant amount of time and resources, since changes in native code
are relatively rare when developing a React Native app.

## Known issues and limitations

- One of limitations of GitHub Actions is that cache is scoped and cannot be accessed between 
  arbitrary branches (see [#79](https://github.com/actions/cache/issues/79)). This means that 
  if a build with specific fingerprint is created on `feature-a` branch, then in `feature-b` 
  branch with the same fingerprint, the build is not visible and the app will be built again.
  However, since the build is also created on main branch, once either `feature-a` or `feature-b`
  is merged to main, the build will be cached and available for all existing and future branches in the repository.
