## ü§î Why?

The problem we noticed is that setting up CI is performed once, needs to be researched every time, and is often trial and error driven. The process is repetitive.

We created a tool that bootstraps CI with the most used features, which are ready for customization in the future. Running `npx setup-ci` generates GitHub workflows for the most popular CI tasks.

## üìñ Usage

Simply go to your project root directory and run:

```
npx setup-ci
```

then select the setup that matches your project - `npx setup-ci` generates workflows and tries to add missing configs and install necessary dependencies.

If your project has a monorepo structure, run the script from the root directory of the app for which you want to set up workflows.

> [!WARNING]
> If you re-run `npx setup-ci` in the same project or already have some workflows set up manually, they might get overwritten. Therefore, we recommend running the script with no uncommitted changes, so you can easily inspect the diff after script execution.

## üí° Demo

Say we want to set up GitHub actions that run Typescript and Prettier checks on our project every time we create or push to an existing Pull Request.
Let's try to use `npx setup-ci` to do the heavy lifting and generate all the necessary configurations.

<p align="center">
  <img 
    style="width: 80%;"
    src="docs/assets/example-usage.gif"/>
</p>

Alternatively, we can use flags `--preset --ts --prettier` to avoid the interactive survey at the beginning of the script. You can check the section below for more information about available flags!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Currently, only GitHub actions are supported as your CI.**
- **npm**, **yarn**, **pnpm** and **bun** are supported as package managers, and they will be detected automatically.
- Monorepo structure is supported, but make sure you run the script from the app directory,
  not the monorepo root.

When using `npx setup-ci`, you can provide additional flags to modify its default behavior.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="160px" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Flag</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--preset</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Run the script with your own preset. Combine it with feature flags to specify what workflows you want to generate.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--skip-git-check</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">By default, the script will prompt the user if there are uncommitted changes in the working repository. Use this flag to proceed without asking.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--skip-telemetry</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Skip sending anonymous metrics.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The following are **feature flags** that can be used with `--preset` flag (they are ignored if `--preset` is not provided).

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="160px" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Flag</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--lint</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Generate ESLint workflow to run on every PR</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--jest</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Generate Jest workflow to run on every PR</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--ts</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Generate Typescript check workflow to run on every PR</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--prettier</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Generate Prettier check workflow to run on every PR</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--eas</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Generate Preview with EAS workflow to run on every PR <b>(Expo projects only)</b>. 
      The workflow uses <a href=https://github.com/expo/expo-github-action/tree/main/continuous-deploy-fingerprint>Expo continuous-deploy-fingerprint action</a>
      to publish EAS Updates and trigger EAS Builds in development profile 
      when the fingerprint of the app changes. You can learn more with Expo documentation on
      <a href=https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/>EAS Build</a>,
      <a href=https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/introduction/>EAS Update</a>
      and <a href=https://expo.dev/blog/fingerprint-your-native-runtime>Expo fingerprint</a>.
      </br>
      Additionally, a comment will be created in your PR with a link to the build 
      and a QR code to scan and open the app on your device with the latest update.

  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--detox</td>

## üîê Repository secrets

Some workflows generated by `npx setup-ci` require setting up repository secrets that can be then accessed by workflows as `${{ secrets.* }}`. Make sure to read logs printed by the script
as you will always be prompted to create secrets if necessary. The following table shows a summary of secrets you might have to create for generated workflows to work properly.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; font-weight: bold">Secret</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; font-weight: bold">Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">EXPO_TOKEN</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Used for authentication in workflows using your Expo account. Learn more at <a href=https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/github-actions>Expo with GitHub actions</a>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## üîç Troubleshooting

For known issues with `npx setup-ci`, please check [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## üìä Metrics

By default, `npx setup-ci` collects anonymous usage data that helps us improve the tool. You can disable it by using the `--skip-telemetry` option.
Collected data consists of timestamp, tool version, selected options, whether the script has been run for the first time and whether it ended with an unexpected error (without stacktrace
so that no sensitive PII can be accidentally leaked).
